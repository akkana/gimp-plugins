GimpLabels

This is a little pair of GIMP scripts which can make it easier to
design and print labels, business cards and other sized objects in
GIMP, using label templates from the gLabels program.

Also, us-letter paper size is the only supported paper so far.
Modifying the code would be straightforward, though.

BUILD/INSTALL OPTIONS

First: the easy way to install if you just want to try out the
script with the labels provided is to copy labels.scm into your
gimp scripts directory. For example, on Linux with GIMP 2.4,
that would be:
  cp labels.scm ~/.gimp-2.4/scripts/

If you want more control or want to add your own labels, read on:

make will build labels.scm, using whatever label templates are
currently in this directory.  gimplabels is shipped with a set
of labels, but if you have a recent version of glabels installed
you may want to update the list by typing:

make templates will update labeltemplates.scm, copying templates
from your gLabels setup in /usr/share/glabels/templates.  If your
glabels is installed anywhere else, you will have to modify the
make-label-fu.py program.  make-label-fu.py also depends on having
python and py-xml installed; if you don't have those, you're probably
best off using the label templates shipped with gimplabels.

make install will install the script to your personal gimp-2.0 or
gimp-2.2 directory.  It relies on having "gimptool" installed.
On some distributions, this is packaged separately from gimp,
in a package called gimp-devel or gimp-dev.  If you can't install
gimptool, you can simply cp labels.scm to ~/.gimp-2.x/scripts/

HOW TO USE GIMPLABELS

Once installed, the scripts should show up in two places:
<Toolbox>/Xtns/Script-Fu/Labels/Rect Label...
    Make a new image with the right aspect ratio for the particular
    rectangular label.

<Image>/Script-Fu/Labels/Rect Label Page...
    Make an image of a page of labels, populating it with the
    current label image.

    Note: the "Printer fudge factor" parameter is to compensate
    for the fact that gutenprint printer drivers never seem to use
    quite the whole page. The default is 0.968, which is about right
    for my Epson C86. I recommend that you print out some test pages
    (in draft mode on cheap paper) and figure out the right fudge
    factor for your printer, then edit the script so that will
    be the default (see the SF-ADJUSTMENT for "Printer fudge factor"
    near the end of the labels.scm).

<Toolbox>/Xtns/Script-Fu/Labels/CD Label...
    Make a CD label blank, with the inner part cut out.

<Image>/Script-Fu/Labels/CD Mask
    Cut out a CD shape from the current image.
